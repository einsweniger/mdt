Development
===========

Where you can help
------------------

Backend:
  * moodle.communication: MoodleSession implements Moodle's Web Service API: it is incomplete and has no support for different service versions.
    Implementing those is tedious, especially since Moodles API is pretty wonky: You will almost always receive 200 OK, and will have to handle exceptions by hand.
  * moodle.models: contains various representations of Moodle data structures.
    They are badly interconnected and need restructuring.

Frontend:
  * wstools: needs command structure. a curses interface and better pretty printing should be nice.


Documentation
-------------

Moodle back-end
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Moodle Developers do not provide direct access to the Web Service API.
The WS API Documentation is only available per Moodle instance, so you are left with some choices:

* Ask your Moodle Administrator for it,
* set-up your own Moodle Instance (I recommend you don't, installation takes a really long time),
* get it from the `Moodle Demo Server <https://moodle.org/demo/>`_,
* dig in Moodle's PHP sources (I also recommend against that, use as last resort. Does not help understanding the data structures.)

This Code
^^^^^^^^^

Well, you are reading itâ€¦ That is how much documentation there is, there will be more, tho.
If you really, really want to help the tool along or ask for an explanation, ask -1 via `twitter <https://twitter.com/einsweniger/>`_ or mail.

Bootstrap
---------

Before starting to develop on manly-man moodle scripts you should run the `boostrap` script.
This will setup `git-flow` with the default settings.

We recommend `git-flow AVH Edition <https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow/>`_.
For detailed installation instructions have a look at `https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow/wiki <https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow/wiki>`_

Working with git-flow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Start a new feature with `git-flow feature start FEATURE_NAME` (this creates a new branch)
2. Hack on your feature
3. Finish your feature with `git-flow feature stop FEATURE_NAME` (this merges the branch into `develop`)
